# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

I am training in the art of debugging through the Webstack debugging series. In this series, I am given broken or bugged webstacks and my goal is to come up with a Bash script that will bring the webstack to a working state. However, before writing the script, I must first figure out what is going on and fix it manually. This is an essential skill for a Full-Stack Software Engineer and it takes practice to become a master of it.
