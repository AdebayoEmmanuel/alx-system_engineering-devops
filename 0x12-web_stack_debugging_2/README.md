Debugging can be frustrating, but it is definitely an important part of my job, it requires experience and methodology to become good at it. The good news is that bugs are never going away, and the more experienced I become, trickier bugs will be assigned to me!

No fit sleep, gat dey grind on!
 Good luck :)
